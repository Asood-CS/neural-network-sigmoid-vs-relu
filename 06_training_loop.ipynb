        "Once the model environment and data collection functions were set up, I implemented a loop to train my network on the normalized wine quality features. This involved cycling through training data for multiple epochs, performing gradient descent at every step. In all iterations of the loop, I made sure to measure my desired metrics for both accuracy and loss curvature, and to log these values into my data frame. This way, I was able to evaluate the progressive improvement of my model with time, seeing how both activation functions contributed to training speed."
